# C-practice

-A set of programs in C for OSU CS-261 Data structures. 

-There are four files which each implement a program that goes over basic programming in the C. The fourth is probably the most interesting as it implements toupper, tolower, strlen, and a camel casing function.

-There is an included makefile for Linux that can be used to build the programs by just typing make.

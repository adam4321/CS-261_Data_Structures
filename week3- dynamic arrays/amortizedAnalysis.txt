How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 50 consecutive push operations 
on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity 
each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) 
grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

capacity = 8
To fill the initial array - 8 cost units / 8 ops
9th push and resize - 9 cost units / 1 op
capacity = 16
Next 7 pushes - 7 cost units / 7 ops
17th push and resize - 17 cost units / 1 op
capacity = 32
Next 15 pushes - 15 cost units / 15 ops
33rd push and resize - 33 cost units / 1 op
capacity = 64
Next 17 pushes - 17 cost units / 17 ops

8 + 9 + 7 + 17 + 15 + 33 + 17 = 106 cost units
8 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 17 = 50 operations

This makes the average time complexity of a push O(1)+

2.
How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 50 consecutive push operations 
on an empty array which starts out at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant
2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of
pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for
a push?

capacity = 8 
To fill the initial array - 8 cost units / 8 ops
9th push and resize - 9 cost units / 1 op
capacity = 10
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op
11th push and resize - 11 cost units / 1 op
capacity = 12
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op
13th push and resize - 13 cost units / 1 op
14
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
16
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
18
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
20
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
22
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
24 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
26 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
28 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
30 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
32 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op

push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
36 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op

push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op

push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
44 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
46 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
48 
push 1 - 1 unit / 1 op 
50

8 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 15 + 1 + 17 + 1 ... + 49 + 1 = 638 cost units
8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ... = 50 operations

This makes the average time complexity of a push O(n)
